# **CO2 Calculator**
## **Purpose of Website**
All the CO2 trip calculators I have used all require you to know how far you have travelled. 
I find this annoying because this means I now need to go onto another application and find out my tripâ€™s length. 
This site now uses the google maps API to get trip details within one application. 
Meaning now the visitor does not need to leave the site to go to another application for site, 
they can get everything they need in one place. 

Stopping visitors from leaving the site to find trip distance will lead to better visitor interaction with the site. 
If they saw that they had to go and find the distance of their trip this may put them off from even using the site,
because they may see it as to much effort.

Another reason behind this website is to show people the impact they have on the planet, 
and to show them how they can help by showing links to other sites that help with CO2 emissions.
Some sites that I have seen show the total cost of the trip and then show what that person. 
can by to offset their single trip. I think this is the wrong way to go about it because this means that person. 
now needs to keep coming back and calculating each trip they take. I have tried to find websites that offer subscriptions.
that cost a certain amount each month and this means that person does not need to constantly worry about calculating each trip.
This site is intended to start a person journey to helping the environment and opening their eyes to new ways to help the environment.
with a simple subscription. Millions of people have subscriptions to Amazon and Netflix, but these subscriptions help our planet.
